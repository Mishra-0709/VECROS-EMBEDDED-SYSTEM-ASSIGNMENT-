# Thrust Stand Embedded System

## Objective

This project aims to design an electronic system for a thrust stand that measures various parameters such as current, voltage, RPM, temperature, and thrust data for a brushless motor. The system utilizes an ESP32 MCU for control and data logging.

## Requirements

1. **Battery Voltage:** Up to 60V
2. **Current Rating:** Up to 60A
3. **Thrust Data:** Up to 5 KG (using an HX711 pressure sensor with Load Cell)
4. **RPM Range Capability:** Up to 100,000 RPM (using an IR photo diode sensor)
5. **Current Sensor:** Must support up to 60A (using an ACS 712 module)
6. **Temperature Sensor:** Up to 150 Â°C

## Parts Selection

- **Microcontroller:** ESP32 MCU
- **Thrust Sensor:** HX711 pressure sensor with Load Cell
- **Voltage Sensor:** To be selected based on requirements
- **Current Sensor:** ACS 712 module
- **RPM Sensor:** IR photo diode sensor
- **Temperature Sensor:** To be selected based on requirements
- **Power Supply:** 4S to 6S LiPo battery
- **Display and Data Logging:** To be selected based on requirements

## Deliverables

1. **Architecture/Block Diagram:**
    - A block diagram that shows the overall system architecture.
    - Includes the battery, ESP32 MCU, pressure sensor, voltage sensor, current sensor, RPM sensor, temperature sensor, display, and data logging components.
    
2. **Schematic Design:**
    - A schematic design illustrating the interconnections between the ESP32 MCU and the various sensors and components.
    - All connections are clear and appropriately labeled.
    - Schematic design is provided in PDF format.
